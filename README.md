# OUP-M
Source for OUP/M - a CP/M-like operating system for 6502

Original source here:
https://archive.org/details/OUPMA6502OperatingSystem

updated source using 6502 Macroassembler & Simulator Verion 1.2.11
tested to compile and run in the emulator OsiEmu15 version 1.5

From the original:
"In the development of OUP/M, an OSI C-3 microcomputer system was used. This system consists of a 6502 CPU, a dual 8-inch floppy disk drive, a console, a printer, and 56 K bytes of RAM. On this machine all I/O is memory mapped and address space layout has to be taken into consideration."
